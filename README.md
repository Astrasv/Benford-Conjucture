# Benford-Conjucture
* Most of the naturally occuring data sets follows Benfords Law and results in a similar pattern of plot all time
* The Tribonacci series is also one of those naturally occuring data set
* This repository contains the verification of Benfords Conjucture plotting with Tribonacci series

> **_NOTE:_**  This specific code not just verifies the Benfords Conjecture for Initial Tribonacci series, but also very for **SUCCESSIVE DIFFERENCE SERIES** for 3 iterations
